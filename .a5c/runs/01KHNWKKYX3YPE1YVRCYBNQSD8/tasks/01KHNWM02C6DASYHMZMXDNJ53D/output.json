Changes: (1) Added 'active: bool = True' to TaskBase model in task.py, (2) Updated _task_from_dict in config_manager.py to read ACTIVE field with default True for backwards compatibility, (3) Updated _task_to_dict in config_manager.py to write ACTIVE field to JSON config, (4) Updated run_batch_reports in fetch_reports_from_alma_analytics.py to filter by active=True when filtering by frequency. Existing tasks without ACTIVE field will default to True ensuring backwards compatibility."
