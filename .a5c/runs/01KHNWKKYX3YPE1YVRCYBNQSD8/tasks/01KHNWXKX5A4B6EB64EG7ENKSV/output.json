  "summary": "All 19 integration tests PASSED. The active filter feature is fully implemented end-to-end: (1) Backend Pydantic models define active: bool = True with proper default, (2) ConfigManager correctly reads/writes ACTIVE field to JSON config, (3) Frontend TypeScript types match backend types, (4) UI components display active status badge and toggle functionality, (5) TaskForm includes active checkbox for create/edit operations, (6) Batch report execution filters out inactive tasks. TypeScript and Python syntax checks all pass."
